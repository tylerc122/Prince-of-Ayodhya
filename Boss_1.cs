/// <summary>
/// SO I DONT FORGET HOW THIS WORKS:
/// First, the boss starts in an Idle state, health is set to 100 (max) and the attack timer starts at zero.
/// When the boss spawns in, attack timer is zero so immediately they will proceed to choose an attack.
/// The boss then moves towards ram using MoveTowardsRam().
/// Once ram is in attack range, IsRamInAttackRange() returns true, which then means a random attack is chosen.
/// This means that ExecuteAttack() is called, the attack name and animation name are set and the currentAttack is set to wtvr the attack is, the animation is also played & state is changed to attack.
/// During the next _PhysicsProcess() call, the boss is now an attack state so PerformAttack() will be called with normal multipliers.
/// Perform attack then checks currentAttack and calls the corresponding method.
/// When the animation is finished, OnAnimationFinished() is called and the boss goes back to idle, unless under 25 hp, then it will stay in enraged mode.
/// Note that many of the attack methods take a damage multiplier parameter, this is only used (in theory) when the boss is in an enraged state.
